What is Mojito?
===============

Mojito is a `model-view-controller (MVC) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>`_ 
application framework built on YUI 3 that enables agile development of Web applications. 
Mojito allows developers to use a combination of configuration and an MVC architecture to 
create applications. Because client and server components are both written in JavaScript, 
Mojito can run on the client (browser) or the server (Node.js).

Mojito offers the following features, some of which are discussed in the next section:

- Local development environment and tools (Yahoo! independent stack)
- Library for simplifying internationalization & localization
- Integrated unit testing
- Device specific presentation (Hero, Mobile, TV, Web, etc.)

Why Mojito?
===========

The best way to illustrate why you should use Mojito for creating Web applications is to 
give an example. Suppose you wanted to create a slideboard application that 
lets users quickly view news articles from various sources. Your application needs to be 
available on a variety of devices and use the appropriate UI elements of the device. 
For example, the application on the Web should provide rich interaction using the mouse, 
whereas, the application on a tablet or phone should provide the same rich interaction 
using the touchscreen.

You also want people from all over to be able to use your slideboard application, so you 
will need to support internationalization and localization. Users should be able to see 
the application in their local language or choose their preferred language.

In the following, we will discuss how Mojito makes it easier to create the slideboard 
application.

.. _mojito_overview_why-one_lang:

One Language
------------

Your slideboard application will need to fetch articles either through some API or an RSS 
feed. Most conventional Web applications that need data have both server-side and 
client-side components. The server-side script, written in a language such as Python, 
Perl, Ruby, PHP, or Java, fetches data and then passes the data to client-side script 
written in JavaScript. The one Web application would have at least two languages and 
would need to make at least two network calls: one to the data source, and one between 
the server-side and client-side code to transmit data.

Because Mojito is written entirely in JavaScript, your application code can run on the
server or be deployed to the client. From the client, you can use the 
`YUI YQL Utility <http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/yql/>`_, to get all types of Web data, 
removing the need for the client to fetch data from your server.

.. _mojito_overview_why-two_runtimes:

Two Runtimes
------------

Your application code can be configured to run on the server or be deployed to the client. 
If your application is configured to deploy code to the client, Mojito will determine 
whether the client can execute JavaScript before deployment. If the client cannot execute 
JavaScript, your application code will instead execute on the server. You write one code 
base, configure where code should optimally run, and then let Mojito determine at runtime 
to either deploy the code or run it on the server. Whether running on the client or server, 
your code can use the `YUI YQL Utility <http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/yql/>`_ to get all 
types of Web data.

.. _mojito_overview_why-device_views:

Views for Different Devices
---------------------------

Your slideboard application is a Web application, but we want users to view it on tablets 
and smart phones as well. Do you create separate versions of your application? Do you 
write code logic that serves the correct version?

Mojito can identify the calling device by examining the HTTP header ``User-Agent``. You 
create custom views for different devices, and Mojito will render and serve the correct 
device-specific views.

.. _mojito_overview_why-prog_enhancement:

Progressive Enhancement
-----------------------

You want your users to be able to take advantage of the rich features of the device they 
are using. Users skimming through articles on an iPad should be able to use the touch 
screen, and Web users should have features such as mouseovers and right-clicks. Handling 
these UI events requires JavaScript, so how do you handle them when the client has 
disabled JavaScript?

Mojito allows you to serve code to the client, so that your users can use the rich 
interactive features of their devices, but Mojito also allows you to handle cases when the 
client has not enabled JavaScript. You can write HTML and CSS so your page functions 
without JavaScript sure that your application works with just HTML and CSS. Because Mojito 
runs on `Node.js <http://nodejs.org/>`_ the code intended to be deployed to the client can 
instead run on the server.

.. _mojito_overview_why-loc_intl:

Localization and Internationalization
-------------------------------------

Mojito is built on `YUI 3 <http://yuilibrary.com/>`_, which has an internationalization 
utility that allows you to handle monolingual and multilingual applications. Using the 
`YUI Internationalization utility <http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/intl/>`_ and 
`Yahoo! Resource Bundles (YRB) <http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/intl/#yrb>`_, your 
slideboard application could use one language for the UI and serve the content in a 
different language.
