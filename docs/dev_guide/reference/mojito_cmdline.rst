===================
Mojito Command Line
===================

Mojito comes with a command line tool that provides a number of key 
capabilities for the developer, from generating code skeletons, to 
running tests and test coverage, to cleaning up and documenting the 
code base.

.. _mj_cmdlne-help:

Help
====

To show top-level help for this command line tool:

``$ mojito help``

To show help for a specific command:

``$ mojito help <command>``

.. _mj_cmdlne-create_code:

Creating Code from Archetypes
=============================

Archetypes are used to create skeletons for the different types of artifacts 
in a Mojito application. The skeletons only contain stripped down boilerplate 
code that is easier to create using the command-line tool rather than by hand.

To create a skeleton for a Mojito application:

``$ mojito create app [<archetype-name>] <app-name>``

This will create an empty application (i.e., one with no mojits) with the name 
provided. The application is created in a directory named ``<app-name>`` within 
the current directory. If no archetype name is provided, the default archetype 
is used.

From the application directory, use the following command to create a skeleton 
for a mojit:

``$ mojito create mojit [<archetype-name>] <mojit-name>``

This will create an empty mojit with the name provided. The command assumes it 
is being executed within an application directory. Thus, the mojit is created 
in a directory named ``<mojit-name>`` within a ``mojits`` subdirectory of the 
application directory. For example, the mojit ``MyMojit`` would be created in 
``mojits/MyMojit``.

As with application creation, if no archetype name is provided, the default 
archetype is used. Depending upon the archetype, the skeleton may include any 
or all of the controller, model, view, and binder.


.. _mj_cmdlne-archetype:

Mojito Archetypes
-----------------

Mojito offers the following three archetypes for applications and mojits.

- ``simple`` - The minimal configuration and code needed to run an application.
- ``default`` - This archetype is run if no command line archetype option is 
  specified. It is a happy medium between ``simple`` and ``full``.
- ``full`` - Provides the most comprehensive configuration and code for 
  applications.
- ``hybrid`` - Creates a hybrid HTML5 application that can be plugged into 
  a future component of Cocktails that will allow HTML5/JavaScript applications 
  to access the features of native devices. 

.. _mj_cmdlne-testing:

Testing
=======

Unit tests are run using YUI Test invoked using the Mojito command-line tool. 
Test output is written to the console and also to the file
``{CWD}/artifacts/test/result.xml``, where ``{CWD}`` is the current working directory. 
Note that it is not (yet) possible to specify an alternative output location.

- To run tests for an application:

  ``$ mojito test app <application-path>``

- To run the unit tests for a specific mojit:

  ``$ mojito test mojit <mojit-path> [<mojit-module>]``

  If a mojit module (i.e., the YUI module for a portion of the mojit) is 
  specified, only the tests for that module will be run. Otherwise all tests 
  for the mojit will be run.

To run functional and unit tests for the Mojito framework,
you would use the test framework `Yahoo! Arrow <https://github.com/yahoo/arrow>`_.
Follow the instructions in `Running Mojitoâ€™s Built-In Tests <../topics/mojito_testing.html#running-mojito-s-built-in-tests>`_
to run the framework tests for Mojito.

.. _mj_cmdlne-code_coverage:

Code Coverage
=============

Code coverage is invoked in the same way as unit testing, but with the added 
option ``--coverage`` or ``-c``. To run code coverage tests, you need to have 
Java installed.

Coverage results are written to the console and also to file in the directory 
``{CWD}/artifacts/framework/coverage/``.  As with unit tests,  it is not 
possible to specify an alternative output location.

- To run code coverage for a Mojito application:

  ``$ mojito test --coverage app <app-path>``

- To run code coverage for Mojito applications:

  ``$ mojito test app <app-path> --coverage``

- To run code coverage for a specific mojit:

  ``$ mojito test -c mojit <mojit-path>``

.. _mj_cmdlne-start_server:

Starting the Server
===================

Use the following to start the server and run the application.

``$ mojito start [<port>] [--context "key1:value1,key2:value2,key3:value3"]``

The port number specified in the command above overrides the port number in 
the application configuration file, ``application.json``. The default port 
number is 8666. See :ref:`Specifying Context <mj_cmdline-context>` to learn 
how to use the ``--context`` option.

.. _mj_cmdlne-js_lint:

Sanitizing Code
===============

Static code analysis is run using JSLint invoked using the Mojito command-line 
tool. JSLint output is written to text files and to a ``jslint.html`` file, 
making it easier to view the results. The output file locations are specified 
below. Note that it is not possible to specify an alternative output location.

- To run JSLint on the Mojito framework code:

  ``$ mojito jslint``

  Output is written to ``{CWD}/artifacts/framework/jslint/``, where ``{CWD}`` 
  is the current working directory.

- To run JSLint on an application, including all of its (owned) mojits:

  ``$ mojito jslint app <app-name>``

  Output is written to ``{app-dir}/artifacts/jslint/``.

- To run JSLint on a specific mojit:

  ``$ mojito jslint mojit <mojit-path>``

  Output is written to ``{app-dir}/artifacts/jslint/mojits/{mojit-name}``/.

.. _mj_cmdlne-document_code:

Documenting Code
================

API documentation is generated using `YUI Doc <http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuidoc/>`_, 
which is invoked using the Mojito command-line tool. Documentation output is 
written to files in the locations specified below. Note that it is not (yet) 
possible to specify an alternative output location.

- To generate documentation for the Mojito framework itself:

  ``$ mojito docs mojito``

  Output is written to ``{CWD}/artifacts/docs/mojito/``, where ``{CWD}`` is 
  the current working directory.

- To generate documentation for an application, including all of its (owned) 
  mojits, run the following from the application directory:

  ``$ mojito docs app``

  Output is written to ``{app-dir}/artifacts/docs/``.

- To generate documentation for a specific mojit, run the following from the 
  application directory:

  ``$ mojito docs mojit <mojit-name>``

  Output is written to ``{app-dir}/artifacts/docs/mojits/{mojit-name}/``.

.. _mj_cmdlne-version_info:

Version Information
===================

- To show the version for the Mojito framework itself:

  ``$ mojito version``

- To show the version for an application, run the following from the 
  application directory: 

  ``$ mojito version app <app-name>``

- To show the version for a mojit, run the following from the application 
  directory:

  ``$ mojito version mojit <mojit-name>``

  Showing the version of the application and mojit requires that they have a 
  ``package.json`` file.

.. _mj_cmdlne-build_sys:

Build System
============

Mojito comes with a build command for generating an HTML5 offline Mojito 
application that runs in different environments. The command must be run inside 
of the application you want built.

``$ mojito build <type> [<output-path>] [--context "key1:value1,key2:value2,key3:value3"]``

Output is written to ``{app-dir}/artifacts/builds/{type}`` by default. See 
:ref:`Specifying Context <mj_cmdline-context>` to learn about the ``--context`` 
option.

.. _build_sys-types:

Build Types
-----------

The following sections describe the available build types.

.. _build_types-html5app:

html5app
########

To build an HTML 5 application, use the the following:

``$ mojito build html5app``

This generates a HTML5 Offline Application with a ``cache.manifest`` listing 
all the files that will be available offline. An ``index.hb.html`` page is 
generated from the result of calling the Web root ``/`` of the Mojito 
application that this command was run within. You can build other pages by 
specifying the pages in the ``"builds": "html5app"`` object in 
``application.json``. The `html5 <../intro/mojito_configuring.html#html5app-object>`_ 
object lets you add the ``manifest`` attribute to the ``html`` element, 
configure relative paths, and specify a list of URLs to pages to generate.

.. _build_types-hybridapp:

hybridapp
#########


To build a hybrid application, use either of the following.

``$ mojito build hybridapp [--context <context>] --snapshotName <snapshot_name> --snapshotTag <snapshot_tag> [<path/to/app/>]`` 

``$ mojito build hybridapp [-c <context>] -n <snapshot_name> -t <snapshot_tag> [<path/to/app/>]`` 


This generates a HTML5 application that is customized to work with a future 
component of the Cocktails suite that will allow you to write HTML5/JavaScript 
applications that can access native features of mobile devices.

The generated application contains Mojito, frame mojits, the default mojit 
``top_frame``, your created mojits, and application configuration. The command 
will also create a ``snapshot.json`` file that can be used tracking and updating applications.


.. _mj_cmdlne-compile_sys:

Compile System
==============

Mojito comes with a compile command for generating files to optimize an application for 
production.

.. _compile_sys-syntax

Syntax
------

Compile files with the command below where ``<type>`` can have the following values: 
``all``, ``inlinecss``, ``views``, ``json``, or ``rollups``.

``$ mojito compile <options> <type>``

In addition, the compile command takes the following three options:

- ``--app``  or ``-a`` - generates files for application-level files, including files in 
  application-level mojits
- ``--clean`` or ``-c`` - cleans up compiled modules
- ``--everything`` or ``-e`` - compiles everything possible and does not require a 
  ``<type>``
- ``--remove`` or ``-r`` - removes the files that were generated

.. note:: The ``--app`` option is not supported for the ``inlinecss``, ``views``, or 
          ``json`` types.

.. _compile_sys-inline_css:

Compiling Inline CSS
--------------------

The command below creates files for adding inline CSS to a page. The CSS files in 
``/mojits/{mojit_name}/assets/`` will be automatically included as inlined CSS in the 
rendered views for mojits that are children of the ``HTMLFrameMojit``.

``$ mojito compile inlinecss``

.. _compile_sys-views:

Compiling Views
---------------

The command below pre-compiles the views in ``mojit/{mojit_name}/views`` so that a mojit's 
controller and binder are attached to the views, making separate XHR call 
(back to the server) unnecessary.

``$ mojito compile views``

.. _compile_sys-config:


Compiling Configuration
-----------------------

The command below using the type ``json`` reads the JSON configuration files, such as the 
specs, definitions, and defaults, and compiles them into JavaScript.

``$ mojito compile json``


.. _compile_sys-rollups:

Compiling Rollups
-----------------

The command below consolidates the YUI modules in the mojits into a single YUI module, 
making only one ``<script>`` tag needed per page. Using the ``--app`` option creates a 
rollup containing all of the application-level YUI modules as well as all of the Mojito 
framework code.

``$ mojito compile rollups``

.. _compile_sys-all:

Compiling All
-------------

The commands below compile inline CSS, views, and YUI modules. 

``$ mojito compile all``

``$ mojito compile -e``

.. _mj_cmdline-dependency:

Dependency Graphs
=================

The command below generates the Graphviz file ``{CWD}/artifacts/gv/yui.client.dot`` 
(``{CWD}`` represents the current working directory) that describes the YUI module 
dependencies.

``$ mojito gv``

The ``mojito gv`` command has the following options:

- ``--client`` - inspects the files that have ``client`` and ``common`` as the affinity. 
  The default is just to inspect files that have ``server`` and ``common`` as the affinity. 
  For example, using the ``--client`` option, the file ``controller.client.js`` and 
  ``controller.common.js`` will be inspected.
- ``--framework`` - also inspects the Mojito framework files.

.. note:: To render the Graphviz files into GIF images, you need the `Graphviz - Graph 
          Visualization Software <http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php>`_.

.. _mj_cmdline-context:

Specifying Context
==================

When configuration files are read, a context is applied to determine which 
values will be used for a given key. The applied context is a combination of 
the dynamic context determined for each HTTP request and a static context 
specified when the server is started. See 
`Using Context Configurations <../topics/mojito_using_contexts.html>`_ for 
more information.

The static context can be specified by a command-line option whose value 
is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is separated 
by a colon. Try to avoid using whitespace, commas, and colons in the keys and values.

``$ mojito start --context "key1:value1,key2:value2,key3:value3"``
