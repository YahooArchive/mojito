action
------

   A method of a mojit instance (``{mojit_instance}.{action}``) that invokes a call to a function of a mojit controller 
   when an HTTP request is made on an associated routing path. For example, suppose the root path is associated with the
   mojit instance and action ``hello.index``, and the ``hello`` instance is of type ``HelloMojit``. When an HTTP request
   is made on the root path, the action ``index`` would invoke the ``index`` function of the ``HelloMojit`` controller.


Action Context
--------------

   The Action Context is an essential element of the Mojito framework that gives you access to the frameworks features from within a controller function. 
   See `Action Context <../api_overview/mojito_action_context.html>`_ in the `Mojito API Overview <../api_overview/>`_ 
   and the `ActionContext Class <../../api/classes/ActionContext.html>`_ in the `Mojito API documentation <../../api/>`_
   for more detailed information.

addon
-----

   A namespacing object attached directly to the Action Context object that provides additional functions. The Action Context 
   object is available in every controller function. See `Mojito API Overview: Addons <../api_overview/mojito_addons.html>`_ for more information.

affinity
--------

   The location where a resource is available. For example, the value for ``{affinity}`` in the file ``controller.{affinity}.js`` 
   could be ``server``, ``client``, or ``common``, depending on where the resource is available. The affinity ``common`` means 
   that the resource is available in both the client and server. If both ``common`` and ``client`` are given, then the ``client`` 
   file is used on the client and the ``common`` file is used on the server. Likewise, if both ``common`` and ``server`` are given, 
   then the ``common`` file is used on the client and the ``server`` file is used on the server.


assets
------

   File resources that are required on the clients. These resources are primarily CSS but can also be JavaScript that is ancillary 
   to and not a core component of the Mojito application. See `Mojito Developer Topics: Assets <../topics/mojito_assets.html>`_ to 
   learn how to use assets in Mojito applications.

autoload
--------

   A directory of a Mojito application containing JavaScript files that use YUI modules added with ``YUI.add``. These files aren't 
   actually *auto-loaded*, but are merely automatically included if required by a YUI module.


binder
------

   Mojit code deployed to the browser that can allow event handlers to attach to the mojit DOM node, communicate with other mojits on 
   the page, and execute actions on the mojit that the binder is attached to. A mojit may have zero, one, or many binders within 
   the ``binders`` directory. See `Mojito Binders <../intro/mojito_binders.html>`_ for more information.


composite mojits
----------------

   When a parent mojit controls the execution and layout of child mojits. See `Mojito Developer Topics: Composite Mojits <../topics/mojito_composite_mojits.html>`_
   for more information.

controller
----------

   In Mojito, the controller is mojit code that can either do all of the work or delegate the work to models and/or views. 
   In the typical case, the mojit controller requests the model to retrieve data and then the controller will serve that 
   data to the views. See `MVC: Controllers <../intro/mojito_mvc.html#controllers>`_ for more information.
   
mojit
-----

   The basic unit of composition and reuse in a Mojito application. It typically corresponds to a rectangular area of a page and 
   is constructed using JavaScript and the `MVC`_.
   
mojitProxy
----------

   The proxy object given to binders that allows them to interact with the mojit it represents as well as with other mojits on the page.
   See the `mojitProxy Object <../intro/mojito_binders.html#mojitproxy-object>`_ and the `MojitProxy Class <../../api/classes/MojitProxy.html>`_
   for more information.
   
Mojito
------

   A Web framework with which applications are written entirely in JavaScript, using an `MVC`_
   approach and allowing for transportable code between client (browser) and server. The framework addresses the combined needs 
   of connected devices and desktops, including disconnected application usage.
   
MVC
---

   Acronym for Model-View-Controller. A software architecture pattern used in software engineering. The pattern isolates "domain logic" 
   (the application logic for the user) from the user interface (input and presentation), permitting independent development, testing 
   and maintenance of each (separation of concerns). See `Mojito Intro: MVC <../intro/mojito_mvc.html>`_ to learn how MVC is used in Mojito.
   
Node.js
-------

   An evented I/O framework for the V8 JavaScript engine on Unix-like platforms that is intended for writing scalable network 
   programs such as Web servers. See `nodejs.org <http://nodejs.org>`_ for more information.

npm
---

   The package manager is for `Node.js`_ and can be used to install and publish code libraries and manage the dependencies among them.
   See `npmjs.org <http://npmjs.org>`_ for more information.
   
   
OAuth
-----

   An open standard that enables users to share information stored on one site with another site without giving out the user ID and password. 
   See the `Yahoo! OAuth Quick Start Guide <http://developer.yahoo.com/oauth/guide/oauth-guide.html>`_ for more information.
   
view
----

   The display element of Mojito that is served to a device. The view is rendered from the template and consists of HTML and CSS.
   See `MVC: Views <../intro/mojito_mvc.html#views>`_ for more information.
   
view partial
------------

   Also referred to as partials, partial views, and partial collection. View partials are collections that can be iterated through to create a document fragment. 
   Using a view partial, you can create that document fragment instead of iterating through the collection in the view.

template
--------

   Template files that are rendered into HTML and served to a device. These templates can contain expressions (Handlebars) or tags (Mustache) that 
   are replaced with values by a view rendering engine.
   
YUI
---
   Acronym for `Yahoo! User Interface <http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/>`_. A set of utilities, written in JavaScript and CSS, 
   for building rich, interactive Web applications.
