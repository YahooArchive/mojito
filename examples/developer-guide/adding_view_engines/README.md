This code example uses a view engine that uses the Handlebars rendering engine.
Thus, you are required to install Handlebars with npm for the example to work.

Before you run the application, please run the following command:

`$ npm install handlebars`

From the application directory, you should see that a `node_modules` directory with Handlebars has been created:

    node_modules
    └── handlebars
        ├── LICENSE
        ├── README.markdown
        ├── bin
        ├── lib
        ├── node_modules
        └── package.json
