# Quickstart Guide

## About the Application

The Quickstart Guide application not only allows you to quickly
learn about Mojito, but also serves as a reference application for
more advanced users.

The application has twelve tiles that you can click or tap
to learn the basics of Mojito. Once you have opened a tile, just
scroll down to read or click on ">>" for the next topic
or "<<" for the previous topic. You can always click on
the **Home** button to return to the main page.

The tiles are numbered to help you rememeber where you left off.
The application also adapts to the device that you're viewing it on,
so the tiles will rearrange themselves on a tablet or phone for
better usability.
