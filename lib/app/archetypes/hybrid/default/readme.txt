This is the Template mojito app which is intended as a starting point for the client's app.

Current status: runs as a simple mojito app using:
$ mojito start

You can build the yahoo.application._template_ package using

$ ./build_for_ychromert

which will also install DEV YUI.

If you want to use minified YUI then edit build_for_ychromert and change ./use_dev_packages to ./use_ship_packages
